# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions with features like transaction amount, time, and class (fraudulent or legitimate). The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains anonymized credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify potential patterns.
   - Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values if any.
   - Perform under-sampling to balance the dataset, as it is highly imbalanced.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select relevant features for model training.

4. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model, such as Logistic Regression.
   - Train the model using the preprocessed data.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Fine-tune the model if necessary.

## Results

- The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test data.
- It successfully identified [insert number] fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in detecting credit card fraud. The model can be used to identify potentially fraudulent transactions and help prevent financial losses. Further improvements can be explored by using different models or feature engineering techniques.
